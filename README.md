# sanFranciscoMoviesProject1
This project contains a data set of movies, which are searchable through user queries. The program should run in a loop that allows the user to issue different queries. The two types of queries are: title KEYWORD and actor KEYWORD. In the ﬁrst case, the program should display the list of all the movies in the data set whose title contains the given keyword (this search should be case insensitive). In the second case, the program should display the list of all the movies with actors whose names contain the given keyword (again, this search should be case insensitive). In both cases, the user may enter a multi-word KEYWORD. On each iteration, the user should be prompted to enter a new query (for which the program computes the results) or the word ’quit’ to indicate the termination of the program.
